At its core an education system is designed to model, transfer, and make better the sum knowledge of a society. To do this it has to model some epistemological processes, namely; determining validity of knowledge, cataloguing knowledge within fields, and transferring knowledge between entities. Now while epistemology’s constant kerfuffle may not have settled on a concrete single system to do these things, the broad strokes of such a system are relatively clear.

_(Editor here, these posts are focusing on education epistemologically rather than socially or societally. We’ll get to addressing those aspects soon enough but if you’ve got any angry rants in the making pertaining to those you may wanna sit on them a tad longer.)_

Determining Validity
--------------------------------------

First off you’d have to have some sort of judgment system for determining a new, suggested piece of information’s validity. In particle physics one of the current methods is determining the recorded data of a phenomenon’s likelihood of occurring randomly to 1 in 3.5 million (you may remember hearing the term 5 sigma) after which a phenomenon’s validity is accepted. This method is essentially perfect for particle physicists dealing with concrete data but not all of us can stick our problems in the LHC and end up with something useful.

In a field such as mathematics then, there are a certain set of axioms held as valid and the method of introducing new valid pieces of knowledge is by logical proofs derived from these axioms. The advantage here is that proofs don’t take up two countries and are much better equipped to deal with abstract, qualitative knowledge, extending our reach from the experimental to the theoretical. This still doesn’t prove universally useful though; try to get a liberal arts or philosophy major in the same room as a complex mathematical proof and they’ll never talk to you again (might be anecdotally biased here).

Instead let’s take something like history in which almost all information is qualitative and, to varying degrees, hard to interpret. Historians can’t rely on mathematical principles or particle colliders. Instead they have to squat in ancient ruins, puzzling over decaying grocery lists, watching for oncoming boulders, where there’s presumably no wifi to answer our emails asking what their daily lives are like. Instead of proofs and experiments historians have to attain new knowledge via analysis of discovered datasets with only peer consensus able to determine the validity, or invalidity, of this analysis. This approach is much more useful to us, as it takes a step back and outlines the best way to figure out what the best way to determine the validity of information is, specifically peer consensus.

This is so useful because it essentially encompasses the other two methods. 5 sigma and mathematical proofs may be standard practice now but some erudite council of scientific elders and a couple drunk Greeks (respectively, despite my fan fiction saying otherwise) figured that those were the best ways to determine that we can call something “true”. In other words we arrived at those ways of determining what information is valid via peer consensus, meaning that we can use peer consensus to do the same again with information in other fields, an ability that will prove invaluable in judging when an education system should or shouldn’t add something to the list of stuff it teaches.

Building the Canon
----------------------------------

Next is figuring out what that stuff is. For a bit of context the most analogous thing in current education to what we’re talking about here is a curriculum. Now, building a curriculum is historically a pretty messy affair, involving numerous boards, money, politics, and even a pretty shady textbook mafia I hear. But it doesn't inherently have to be this way. While the problem of figuring out what’s in a curriculum may seem different from determining a presented piece of information’s validity the only thing that really separates the two is time. All of that “old” information in a curriculum, be it those multiplication tables that kept you from recess or that essay on Hobbes’ Leviathan that made you miss that party your crush was at, was once going through the peer consensus process same as “new” information and is a portion of the curriculum now because it was determined valid. Bad for ninth grade you’s love life but great for anyone trying to make a new curriculum (namely; us) as they can process all incoming information via the peer consensus process, treating old and new information the same.

Passing it on
----------------

Lastly in this whole scheme is how best to get all this valid information into people’s heads. Now, from a theoretical standpoint this problem has so much variance that a single definitive answer is essentially impossible (despite what Ray Kurzweil and the Wachowskis may lead you to believe). Each student will have their own preference for information presentation, a unique relationship with their teacher, preferences for topics, etc, all meaning that the teacher student dynamic must be dealt with on an individual level rather than a purely systemic one. The best way for a system to deal with this then is to presuppose that some form of this information transfer is going to happen and simply create an environment that rewards the best instances of it, while never forcing a teacher to break, in any way, the personalized approach to teaching they take with each student. Not as clear cut as peer consensus (by necessity by our reckoning) but this gives us at least two rules and an axiom for this part of the process to run on.

Now that we’ve got a reasonably good outline of the epistemological system that education emulates we can hold that outline to any specific education system and determine its success in this emulation, and if we (**spoilers**) find it lacking, figure out how to make it a bit more successful. That in part 2.
