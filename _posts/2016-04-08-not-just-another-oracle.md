There are as of now, at least 3 major oracle applications in the decentralized applications space. Two of them, [Augur](https://augur.net/) and [GroupGnosis](https://groupgnosis.com/) are based on Ethereum, and the fourth, [TruthCoin/Hivemind](http://bitcoinhivemind.com/) is planned to be a Bitcoin Sidechain. So you could say this space is pretty competitive. In fact it’s a pretty scary space judging by the zero lost love between the minds behind Hivemind and the Augur developers. However, we’re not really worried about all that since...

_**We are not solving the same problem**_

So how’re we different?
-----------------------------------

All the aforementioned services are essentially truth-tellers, dealing **solely** with quantitative results. Infact, as far as I know, some of them as of now only deal with binary events. So first our first key different emerges:

_We concern ourselves with **any** arbitrary event_

This is enabled by a second factor. The oracles behind the prediction markets call from an essentially open pool of reporters. They have no way to tell what a reporter is actually capable of reporting, and so have to focus on only those outcomes any human being can accurately report. Note that this isn’t actually a problem since these Oracles are directly tied to Prediction Markets, which require indisputable outcomes. But since _we have a fine grained understanding of what our assessors (AKA reporters) know and are capable of_, we are then capable of assessing any event, of any kind.

This in turn is possible because of one other way we defer from the standard Oracle model. And I will be upfront and say this is the most important and possibly the least “secure” part of our system, so if there are any socio-economists out there who have some criticisms, please, please bring them up. That being said I think it’s pretty cool.

So the standard oracle network, in the end, reward their reporters Financially. We however, _reward our assessors with the opportunity to be assessed_. Our token (which we **really** need to get a name for) is not directly tradable, nor does it have any financial value, in terms of Ether or BTC. Instead, one can redeem it to call assessors.

Why?
--------------------------------------

A couple reasons. For one we want to promote the proliferation of data in the system, and encourage people to be assessed. Giving them the direct means to do so is a pretty strong encouragement.


Secondly, we conversely need to motivate people to be assessors.  This is because we cannot count on the broad network to fulfill our needs, so we need specific people constantly being available to assess. Our system only works when peers are motivated to add data on themselves to the system, and so is uniquely suited for Education. In an educational system everyone **must** be assessed, somehow, and so we leverage that need to serve the whole system.

Finally, overarchingly  we want to always promote the exertion of one’s abilities.  We want people to always be active, to be putting their knowledge and skills to use, and to push themselves forward. We want to call people to add to the global sum of human knowledge. And so we don’t want to incentivize people with a broad financial reward, but rather a focused pedagogical and epistemological opportunity.
