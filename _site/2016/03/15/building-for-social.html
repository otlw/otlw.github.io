    <div class="post__content"?>
        <p>When designing our system we paid very, very close attention to the social constructs it would spawn. It’s essentially the third layer of our application.</p>

<p>We realized, early on, that because of the decentralized nature of what we’re building, we wouldn’t be able to control many things other social applications take for granted. We wouldn’t for example, be able to ban users, or give them accolades. We couldn’t block actions because they were unproductive, or direct efforts to specific areas. We, in fact, wanted it this way, as we are extremely cynical of our, or any single party’s, ability to manage a system sustainably.</p>

<p>So we shipped this out from the static, slow changing, and developer controlled <strong>back end</strong> to the fluid, open to all, and community controlled <strong>social layer</strong>.</p>

<p>The chief example of this is in our hierarchical tag based data structure. We didn’t want to make any assumptions at all about what a user might want to get assessed. So the solution was to just have an arbitrary structure for linking data, with meaning emerging as needed. Think of our tags like hashtags, quickly rising to assume any meaning, with anyone able to make them.</p>

<h1 id="community-around-data">Community around data</h1>

<p>However, hashtags generally don’t make sense if you’re the only one using them, and in the same way, tags lack meaning if only you possess them. We encourage people to leverage existing tags, as they’ll offer more accurate assessment, rather than rolling your own brand new 0-dependency tag. In this way we want to see certain tags emerge as community strongholds, “canon” versions so to speak. A tag would essentially be defined by the community of assessors it contains, with the entire community acting as an arbiter of who gets to be “in-the-club”.</p>

<p>In this way certain tags can build momentum as communities, with other tags then building off them as peripheries.</p>

<p>We also encourage social consensus through our assessment process. There needs to be a broad public agreement on what certain things mean, so that assessors, when confronted with them, know how to respond.</p>

<p>This presents an opportunity and a challenge. For one, it will be incredibly interesting to see what communities and cultures emerge around the assessment process. But the risk here is the same for any social area, it may be entirely co-opted for something in opposition to its original purpose.</p>

<h1 id="whatre-we-going-to-do">What’re we going to do?</h1>

<p>Honestly, there may not be very much we can do to deal with this. What emerges will emerge, all we can do is ensure our technical backend can handle any use case. The little more we can do will come in the form of little infusions of culture, trickling down from how we, as developers, carry ourselves and our platform.</p>

<p>To me this is the most interesting emergent property of the blockchain by far. It allows us to build systems that can truly independently influence, create, and interweave with, social interaction.</p>

<p>Through our contracts and design we can provide direction and incentive for the emergence of community definitions and meaning, and that’s just incredibly exciting.</p>
