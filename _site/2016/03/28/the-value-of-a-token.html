    <h1 class="post__title">The Value of a Token</h1>
    <p class="post__date">March 28, 2016</p>
    <div class="post__content"?>
        <p>There are two types of currencies, fiat and commodity, and either can be created through ethereum. Fiat, the latin for “let it be done”, is regulated, created, and justified by a central authority, and more importantly, has no intrinsic value of its own. Commodity currencies do, and in addition they often are not created or monitored by a single central party as fiat money usually is.</p>

<p>Our token, which we really need to name at some point, falls firmly into the commodity camp, meaning it has a fundamental value. It creates assessment. And, it is not distributed or controlled by an entity, but rather is spawned by the work of assessment, even <strong>mined</strong> one could say. This gives it a fundamental value which allows us to leverage it for all sorts of things, such as spam prevention.</p>

<p>However we also encode a <strong>functional</strong> value. It can be used to call up on the experience of others, to verify your own. Much like many rare metals, our token is valuable not only because it is hard(ish) to produce, but because it has an actual use.</p>

<p>Of course one can completely disregard it’s value if they want to; it must be leveraged correctly in order to have a purpose, much in the same way gold must be worked in order to harness its conductive properties. But if used correctly, it unlocks a world of use for the individual.</p>

<p>What we have here is the tokenization of action and experience, fundamental portions of learning. Both being assessed, and assessing, are operating on experiences, on <strong>doing</strong>. Users are essentially able to trade the use of their own learning, for the use of other’s.</p>

<h1 id="a-social-network-of-doing">A Social Network of Doing</h1>

<p>I think that’s pretty crazy, and I think others will too. We’re essentially creating an economy, or maybe even a social network, around action, and we’re hoping it’ll lead to some really interesting interactions.</p>

<p>For example, a subset of users may as a group decide to only accept the tokens that have been “minted” from a specific foundry, that is to say, have been earned by completing a certain task, or even propose a secondary valuation of the token, to certain standards of their own, stamping it into a coin, to continue the metaphor. All of this is possible because we have the full history of tokens on the blockchain, and hence can trace it back through all of its transactions.</p>

<p>We plan to apply this to education, but because we’re leaving our system open it could have massive benefits for any social environment where history between the participants is necessary. Imagine an exclusive nightclub that requires proof one has accomplished a certain task, or an online competition, or simply just an interaction with a stranger on the other side of the globe where you really, <strong>really</strong> need to prove you once built a trebuchet to industrial standards.</p>
