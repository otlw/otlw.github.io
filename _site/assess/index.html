    <div class="post__content">
        <p>otlw-assess is a network based system of assessment. It forms a universal layer capable of assessing any quantifiable goal through <em>schelling point assessment</em>, where multiple qualified assessors attempt to arrive at a result as close to each other as possible in order to be rewarded with tokens, which can then be used to initiate assessments of their own goals in turn.</p>

<p>The network is complete decentralized and robust, making as few assumptions as possible about assessors, assessments, or goals.</p>

<h1 id="our-lightpaper">Our “Lightpaper”</h1>
<p>In our lightpaper we aim to fully describe the design of the our system and its major implications. This is a live document and is a work in progress, so any suggestions or questions can be directed at <strong>jared(at)otlw.co</strong></p>
