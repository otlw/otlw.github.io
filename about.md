Built on top of the Ethereum blockchain **otlw** draws multiple validated assessors to judge an individual's achievement who must in turn act as assessors for that and similar achievements  

### Design
* Contract based structure
* Universal applications
* Schelling Point assessment (see Vitalik's [post](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/03/28/schellingcoin-a-minimal-trust-universal-data-feed/))


### Education
We believe that education is a universal human right and shouldn't be limited by location or finances. This system of assessment, universal and decentralized, will provide the foundation for a truly open educational institution.
