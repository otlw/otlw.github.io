---

We are a development group building robust decentralized applications on top of emerging technologies such as [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) and [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)

# What do we do?
We design and build social decentralized systems to replace our current societal infrastructure. We focus on applications with universal impact, such as education, identity building, and reputation.

# Where are we based?
We have team-members in NYC, Baltimore, and Dubai, and were founded in Nairobi, Kenya.
