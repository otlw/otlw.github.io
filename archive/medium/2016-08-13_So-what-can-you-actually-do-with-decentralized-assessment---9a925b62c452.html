To remedy that here are some reasons.</p><h4 name="97c0" id="97c0" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Wait hold up. What <em class="markup--em markup--h4-em">is</em> this assessment thing?</h4><blockquote name="dd25" id="dd25" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--h4">Our decentralized assessment system enables the assessing items based on the consensus of qualified individuals. It is a way to prove things are valid using people who have been proven (by the system) to know what they’re talking about. Peers are motivated both to be assessed and to be assessors, and are incentivized to be as accurate as possible.</blockquote><blockquote name="4c85" id="4c85" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--pullquote">- from our <a href="http://otlw.co/assess/" data-href="http://otlw.co/assess/" class="markup--anchor markup--pullquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lightpaper</a>, which you should read if you want more depth.</blockquote><p name="5a69" id="5a69" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">The tools we have at our disposable are:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="b20e" id="b20e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">An ontology described through tags</li><li name="0fc3" id="0fc3" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Assessments (duh)</li><li name="4543" id="4543" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Lists of addresses which have been assessed, both successfully and unsuccessfully</li></ul><p name="e575" id="e575" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">So, with that out of the way, what can we do with them?</p><h3 name="95fa" id="95fa" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">1. We can get everybody on the same page</h3><p name="ad4e" id="ad4e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Wouldn’t it be neat if people could just understand your qualifications? No more of that “Oh you’re a psychologist, can you tell me what am I thinking?”. Instead you could simply point interested people to your collection of achievements, each pertaining only to a specific skill.</p><p name="04c5" id="04c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This specific skill has only one definition, but that definition isn’t static. Its built around peer consensus and so reflects the shared definition of the community in question. No more outdated curricula and competing arbitrary rules.</p><h3 name="50f1" id="50f1" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">2. Groups and third-parties can easily define their requirements or curricula</h3><p name="9aa5" id="9aa5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Using these same well-defined atomic skills, third-parties, such as colleges or school boards, can easily define their own curriclua. Jobs can describe their requirements in clear terms, and job seekers can immediately aim to get certified in them.</p><p name="2ec2" id="2ec2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The certification industry is a big and messy one with very little interoperability. The assessment network, with its database of crowd-defined skills, acts as a perfect intermediate layer for it.</p><h3 name="0541" id="0541" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">3. People across the world can learn together</h3><p name="b37b" id="b37b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">But defining and proving skills aren’t the hardest parts of education. Organizing people for learning together isn’t exactly trivial either, which is why we have hundreds of thousands of schools to deal with it. Try as they might the current leaders of digital education aren’t really managing to make it happen either. They’re really good at empowering individuals, but bringing groups together is harder.</p><p name="82ca" id="82ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The main difficulty lies in ensuring that all members of a learning group are on the same page. They need to trust that they all have the background necessary to move forward.</p><p name="88da" id="88da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, using the system of assessment together with a database of what skills require what others, dependencies if you will, allows one to enter a group learning environment with specific defined goals (using the same community consensus of course) and know explicitly that your peers are qualified.</p><p name="dd32" id="dd32" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is one of the most important applications to me. High quality <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">relevant </em>peers are an incredibly important part of one’s learning experience, and having a way to engage with them trustlessly, for any purpose, and on any terms you choose, is a powerful tool.</p><h3 name="29a0" id="29a0" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">4. Anyone can prove anything</h3><p name="c01b" id="c01b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This is even more powerful in that its automatically extended universally. Anyone can be assessed by the system, and then has full ownership of that assessment, and can display it to whom they please.</p><p name="45b1" id="45b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is simply not possible with current educational and certification infrastructure, with some terrible consequences. The costs associated with sending transcripts can mess up a students college applications <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w19480" data-href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w19480" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">subtlety but drastically</a>.</p><p name="3db1" id="3db1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The platform is open to anybody, regardless of age, ethnicity, location, or any other arbitrary factor. In fact, the system <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">forces</em> all assessors to treat them equally, through the schelling point assessment mechanism.</p><h3 name="1911" id="1911" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">5. Testing can be decoupled from learning</h3><p name="29c0" id="29c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Learning institutions can use this same testing mechanism to their advantage. Instead of focusing on designing their own tests which gets expensive and can lead to teaching to the test, they can just teach to the best of their ability and use our assessment system to handle the rest.</p><h3 name="f3ec" id="f3ec" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">5. People can prove they’re people</h3><p name="ec62" id="ec62" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This one’s pretty simple, but assessments can also be used as anti-sybil mechanism because they’re hard to get and require human effort. A DApp could limit its user base to only those who possessed a certain achievement, and get instant spam control.</p><h3 name="2c39" id="2c39" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">6. Qualified oracles can answer queries</h3><p name="eacd" id="eacd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Achievements signify much more than just being human though. The system essentially maintains a list of “experts”, or knowledgeable individuals, in every tag it stores. This allows assessments to be used to provide an oracle service that cannot be done by simple crowd polling.</p><p name="4680" id="4680" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One could for example submit a paper to be assessed under certain criteria to the community of scientists which possessed the relevant skills.</p><p name="4b40" id="4b40" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Math problems, computing tasks, even jobs, all could be directed and requested from individuals guaranteed to be qualified.</p><h3 name="be77" id="be77" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">7. DAOs can be built around individuals with certain skill sets</h3><p name="16a0" id="16a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">These communities don’t just existed to be utilized, they can be self-organizing towards their own goals. A DAO could be created for example that allowed every person with a specific tag to have a say in what it’s dependencies were. We could crowd source learning paths and much more. Standards could be set, funds could be appropriated, all with the knowledge that only appropriately skilled individuals are taking part in the decisions.</p><h3 name="b373" id="b373" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">8. These ideas can be extended however one see’s fit</h3><p name="1f9c" id="1f9c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This is the most important one, and the reason why we’re on the <a href="https://ethereum.org/" data-href="https://ethereum.org/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ethereum</a> platform in the first place. As I touched on <a href="https://blog.otlw.co/why-i-love-steemit-but-still-wish-it-was-on-ethereum-601fec6d4c6c" data-href="https://blog.otlw.co/why-i-love-steemit-but-still-wish-it-was-on-ethereum-601fec6d4c6c" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>, the power of the platform is its extendable nature and the interoperability between the applications that run on it.</p><p name="03df" id="03df" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We’re not trying to build an entire education platform, we’re trying to build universal educational infrastructure that can support any use case imaginable. So we tried to be abstract as possible in our design, to allow for implementations we couldn’t even dream of.</p><p name="51ff" id="51ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">In short, that’s not all folks. These are just a few applications that will be possible. We’re going to be exploring, and developing more. If you have any other ideas, please do let us know.</p></div></div></section>
