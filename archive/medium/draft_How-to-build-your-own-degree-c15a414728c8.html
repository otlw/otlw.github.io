<section name="922e" class="section section--body section--first"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="2652" id="2652" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading graf--title">How to build your own degree</h3><p name="acdc" id="acdc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">As you’re reading this, the opportunity to learn <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">anything</em> <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">you want</em> is at the tip of your fingers. You have access to the greatest repository of human knowledge and the tools to leverage it to get anything you want into your head. But the minute you want to tell someone what you’ve got in there, you’re torn from this free golden age of self-direction and forced into an antiquated clusterfuck of tradition and inefficiency that’ll cost you years of your time and tens of thousands of dollars (i.e. College).</p><p name="b4f9" id="b4f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But you’ll do it anyway because it’s impossible to understate the importance of communicating what you can do. You need to be able to to learn with others and to work with them. That communication of your identity, of what you know and what you can do, is what enables our global society of 7.4 billion people to function, for economies to grow, and for companies to build the future.</p><p name="0a56" id="0a56" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To take a step back, humans were really meant for social communities consisting of maximum,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar&#39;s_number" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> at an estimate</a>, 150 other people. That’s the limit at which we can build trust and knowledge of each other organically. We naturally build and communicate our identities through the slow accumulation of shared experiences and interactions.</p><p name="c146" id="c146" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This doesn’t work today. Our universities have populations in the tens of thousands, as do our companies, not to mention our cities of millions on millions of people. We had to have systems in place to do the process differently.</p><p name="b76f" id="b76f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The entire trillion dollar public and private education industry has been our attempt at building those systems. We offloaded trust and identity from organic peer-to-peer interactions onto institutions in order to achieve the scale necessary for our rapidly expanding economies and social environments.</p><p name="92d6" id="92d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The problem is institutions can’t really cater to the diversity of potential experiences that individuals can have if left to their own devices. So instead of dealing with that, they cut down those possibilities to something manageable, by only teaching and certifying a small subset of those experiences, i.e Standardized Curricula.</p><p name="a882" id="a882" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This has huge advantages in resource consumption too. Books are scarce, teachers are scarce, infrastructure is inexpensive, and so instead of trying to tackle everything you set limitations on what you teach and certify, and because education is pretty much an oligopoly, you just set those limitations on everyone. This standardizes identity.</p><p name="9c6d" id="9c6d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One can argue though that this isn’t such a bad thing. Its led to a global increase in all sorts of literacy and has allowed more individuals to rapidly enter the workforce than ever before. This standardization of experience<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDZFcDGpL4U" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDZFcDGpL4U" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> enabled the industrial revolution</a> and opened the doors for the the global communication and intermingling that has enabled so much of the progress that we’ve enjoyed in the modern age.</p><p name="a3b8" id="a3b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Or well, let me rephrase, this wasn’t such a bad thing. For the time. The time being roughly 200 years ago</p></div></div></section><section name="8610" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="0636" id="0636" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Simply put we’ve reached a point where the efficiency gained from the standardization of experience is far outstripped by the efficiency lost by the stifling of diversity.</p><p name="e2e7" id="e2e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And it really is solely credentialing that is holding back that potential explosion of skills and experience. The centralization of learning is in its death throes; we live in a post information scarcity world. We’re going to experience a massive wave of both supply and demand of highly educated individuals in fields more diverse than you can shake a stick at(bit iffy). And if we don’t have the right structures in place that wave is going to break before it hits the shore.</p><p name="c2ee" id="c2ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Again, you can learn anything you want to today (with an internet connection), and you probably want to, but you can’t prove it in a universally meaningful way. We need to decouple learning from certifying, which really is<a href="http://www2.itif.org/2016-disrupting-higher-education.pdf" data-href="http://www2.itif.org/2016-disrupting-higher-education.pdf" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> long overdue</a> even without the fact the former has outpaced the latter.</p><p name="6ac8" id="6ac8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">We need a new paradigm of credentials to match this new environment where your GitHub can matter as much as your degree. One that actually enables the communication of the huge and varied possibilities in learning without compromising efficiency and security.</p></div></div></section><section name="0e63" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="42b7" id="42b7" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">The system must be:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="da97" id="da97" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Accessible to anyone in the world</li><li name="11df" id="11df" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Fair and secure</li><li name="baea" id="baea" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Verifiable and auditable</li><li name="f1f2" id="f1f2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Able to catch bullshit</li><li name="4082" id="4082" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Intrinsically meaningful</li><li name="7d27" id="7d27" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Applicable to anything</li></ol><p name="c9c8" id="c9c8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Those last three we’re pretty great at. Humans, as a whole, have a pretty solid bullshit detector, and our systems of reputation and evidence have a strong underlying meaning and can be applied to just about anything. But, as we’ve already said, they fail at scale.</p><p name="db17" id="db17" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We need that organic flexibility that defines the peer-to-peer communications that come naturally to us, but more transparent, secure, scalable and trustworthy.</p><p name="6c9a" id="6c9a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A transparent, secure, scalable, and trustworthy P2P system you say? Enter The Blockchain; a distributed database that anyone in the world can interact with, as long as they play by the rules.</p><p name="9274" id="9274" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What it allows us to do is take the social protocols that form the basis of our society and rework them for the digital age and global community we have today. Bitcoin, for example, takes the simple idea of handing someone cash (or signing a cheque) and implements it in a way that is scalable (well sort of), secure, transparent, and intrinsically meaningful.</p><p name="7d52" id="7d52" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We need to do the same to the process of taking a look at some evidence, saying “Yeah that person knows what they’re talking about” and certifying their experience.</p><p name="ccf2" id="ccf2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">We can do this. We can leverage incentive mechanisms and game theoric models, to create a network that allows anyone to get assessed in anything by combining multiple assessments from reputable individuals. By codifying that simple social process we can make it universal and secure. In a way what we’re doing is, instead of standardizing experiences, standardizing the way we communicate and talk about experiences.</p></div></div></section><section name="b8c2" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="56b2" id="56b2" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">If we get this right, and enable anyone to prove what they know and what they can do universally and trustlessly, we open the floodgates for the coming wave of highly educated, highly effective, and highly motivated world citizens.</p><p name="f664" id="f664" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We enable a flourishing of diverse educational experiences that will lead directly to that. People will be able to learn whatever they want, however they want, and still get the same credential for it.</p><p name="d50a" id="d50a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And people will be able to operate on these credentials in radically new ways. This is where Ethereum in particular as a blockchain<a href="https://blog.otlw.co/ethereum-and-education-are-a-perfect-match-85750a3bcbe4" data-href="https://blog.otlw.co/ethereum-and-education-are-a-perfect-match-85750a3bcbe4" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> really shines</a>. Because it’s so extensible people can take these credentials and build new decentralized trustless applications on top of them.<a href="https://github.com/otlw/groups" data-href="https://github.com/otlw/groups" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Group learning</a>,<a href="https://github.com/otlw/publish" data-href="https://github.com/otlw/publish" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> decentralized publications</a>, and many, many more we haven’t even thought about.</p><p name="b548" id="b548" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is what education needs, a way to talk about, and hence operate on, the huge variety of potential experiences that are possible. And that language needs to be universal, because we aren’t local players anymore. Individuals coming out of schools are going to be, by necessity, taking part in a global society. What we’re building, a system powered by Ethereum and based on the social structures that map directly to the processes of education, is going to enable that.</p><p name="8cb8" id="8cb8" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
