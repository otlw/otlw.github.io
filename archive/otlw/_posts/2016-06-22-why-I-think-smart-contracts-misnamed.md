title: "Why I think Smart Contracts are Misnamed"
---
Ethereum's analogy to legal systems is, at this point, doing far more damage than good to its public perception. I'd go as far as to equate its effect to the pegging of blockchains to currency that we saw in the technology's infancy. When dealing with new systems it is of course important to relate them to ideas already in place, but it is also important to address their fundamentally new capabilities in abstract terms, or else run the risk of limiting public thought on the subject as we are seeing now.

The term Smart Contracts inevitably evokes legal and fintech applications, which are no doubt a large part of the utility of the Ethereum platform. Smart Contracts can, of course, be just that; smart contracts. Coded agreements between two parties, stored immutably on the blockchain, in _relatively_ clear terms, capable of executing their own logic reliably and moving value.

They can, however, be much more. They can be systems of data storage, not meant to be self enforcing, but meant to store history. They can, when combined with a robust random number generator, be sources of truly fair systems, such as juries, or in the case of our work, assessments.

The discourse around them, especially in the last couple of weeks, due to the DAO fiasco, has centered around their fallibility. The DAO had a broken system, and because it defined itself as an infallible smart contract, was doomed to allow a hacker to walk away with millions.

However for another example we can look at our system, otlw-assess. Let's assume for a moment that a hacker breaks our system and manages to generate infinite funds, or perhaps, start removing achievements from people, or simply functionality from contracts. Our application, and our smart contracts are essentially broken. However the _history_ that individuals have built up is intact. Because of the nature of Ethereum, it’s trivial for another smart contract to be written, fixing the flaws in the first while still integrating its valid history.

By their very nature hacks are high profile, which allows a very clear division in history to emerge, a time pre-hack and a time post-hack. Because the system is organized, and billed as a datastore, a hack can’t really destroy it in any meaningful way.

The billing of Ethereum as a “Smart Contract” platform evokes the idea of DAOs, as an infallible system that will, by virtue of its underlying freedom, inevitably have some failures. It leads countless individuals to decry the turing completeness of the platform, and to point out the _obvious_ flaw: that no digital system can be “self-enforcing”. Well no shit. But a digital system can provide a fantastic record of agreements and their implications, of transferences of value, and of consensus, and its terminology should reflect that.
