title: A decentralized system of assessment
---

otlw-assess is a network based system of assessment. It forms a universal layer capable of assessing any quantifiable goal through _schelling point assessment_, where multiple qualified assessors attempt to arrive at a result as close to each other as possible in order to be rewarded with tokens, which can then be used to initiate assessments of their own goals in turn.

The network is completely decentralized and robust, making as few assumptions as possible about assessors, assessments, or goals.

# Our "Lightpaper"
In our lightpaper we aim to fully describe the design of the our system and its major implications. This is a live document and is a work in progress, so any suggestions or questions can be directed at **jared(at)otlw.co**
