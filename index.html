    <h1>A Decentralized System for Education and Assessment</h1>

      <h2>The necessity of a new educational system</h2>
      <p><span class="newthought">Centralized learning</span> institutions serve a limited student population, provide them with curricula and assessments that hinder them,<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Standardized tests and assesssment force standaradized curriculum, and vice versa, which cut off students' learning oppurtunities.</span> and compete with other institutions for resources and teachers, all detracting from the overall system. This element of competition is the reason why simply throwing funds into the current system can't fix it, as wealthy individuals will always be able to obtain more of a scarce resource.<label for="2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="2" class="margin-toggle"/> <span class="sidenote"> Even the smallest student-teacher ratios still require a standard curriculum for the entire class over long periods of time. </span> The dichotomy between teachers/assessors and students only exacerbates this shortage and limits an institution's potential reach. The overall result of these flaws is a sacrifice of a necessary element – the freedom for individuals to choose their own educational paths.</p>

      <p>These problems can be overcome by a decentralized network based on user-set goals, peer assessment by those with valid experience, and individually motivated group learning. The classroom and course structure can be replaced by a system in which all users function as both students and assessors.</p>

      <p>This decentralized system of education and assessment would be available to all without limits regardless of wealth, social standing, or location and would provide the foundation for a truly meritocratic society.</p>

      <h2>Assessment, goals, and users</h2>

      <p><span class="newthought">Assessment forms</span> the core of an educational system but is often expensive and inefficient, requiring vetting of individual assessors or teachers, or the creation of standardized tests.<label for="3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">These are expensive to make, must be kept secure, must be easily assessable in batch amounts, and most importantly, tend to become the factor being assessed themselves, i.e teaching to the test.</span> Instead we can use multiple independent assessors with the average of their assessments being accepted as the user’s “grade” Assessors who score the user close to that average are awarded tokens which are used, in turn, to initiate assessments of themselves.</p>

      <p>These assessments can be trusted because it is in the assessor's best interest to be accurate<label for="4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="4" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Really it is in their best interest to collude, but as the assessors don't know each other they gravitate towards a natural focal point: the truth. The creation of other focal points is limited by the short time-frame.</span> so that they: are closer to the average, rewarded, and can continue to participate in the system. Trust is built over time as more and more information is added to the system on individuals, each data point attested to by previous assessments.</p>

      <p>The assessment process can also be used to motivate learning as users in the system can pool their tokens into groups. This pooling gives each user a vested interest in the overall group and its goals, which are created after the individuals are collected together.<label for="5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="5" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"> These groups can have previous expereience with each other or be created randomly within the system, as per the users' needs.</span> Groups can provide support, mentorship, or simply camaraderie in the same task, and can even function to break down goals impossible for a single user into doable chunks for the individual members. This makes them a robust tool for skill acquisition and for gaining new experiences and meeting like-aimed individuals.<label for="6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="6" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">These interactions can be as simple as two people working on similar homework problems sharing a chat room or as elaborate as an open-source project with a development time-line.</span></p>

      <p>These experiences are defined, by the users themselves before assessment, through tags. These tags can be anything, essentially just defining the experience or goal a user wants to have. Their meaning is generated as the system grows, the more a tag is used throughout the system; the more general it is, the less; the more specific. Assessors are paired with users based on tags they’ve previously completed, specific tags having priority, so that users with the most pertinent knowledge are assessing appropriately. As more data builds in the system, both pairing and assessment will become more efficient, potentially allowing for the assessment and completion of any kind of goal imaginable with people all around the world.</p>

      <h2>Why a decentralized design</h2>
      <p><span class="newthought">Education is a</span> human right and must be accessible to all equally along with opportunities for personal growth and the ability to testify to that growth. Decentralization<label for="7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="7" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Current institution are decentralized in a sense that students move between them semi-freely, but they are all linked by standardization often set by a central body.</span> assures this by removing the central authority that could impose limitations or even censorship onto the system and by requiring only computer access for participation. It allows individuals to define their own goals and prove their achievements,<label for="8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="8" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Supporting users in goals that they place value on, but that the system might not, is an essential element of a system that can grow and adapt.</span> without any predetermined tests or monolithic curriculum. Most importantly, it also removes any individual power to purchase better educational opportunities, as everyone must be an equal participant and thus has access to all opportunities within the system. </p>

      <p>A meritocracy functions on these elements: accurate unbiased reporting and equal opportunity for all, both embodied in our system. The system could aid a meritocratic organization, such as an institution making a hire, by providing a categorized system of verifiable achievements. With this, individuals and institutions can prove that both they and others have certain credentials in an open and secure way. Because it is open data, everyone has access to it and every user can be held accountable. </p>

      <h2> How to decentralize the system</h2>
      <p><span class="newthought">The blockchain</span> provides a perfect platform for this system. It is a distributed ledger that is secured through consensus and, as such, provides a reliable data store for achievements arrived at through consensus. It requires no vetting or trusted parties to maintain and can be easily accessed through the network. The blockchain is secured through miners,<label for="9" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="9" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">These individuals are essentially glorified bookkeepers, keeping track of all valid updates to the network. In bitcoin they are motivated by financial rewards but here they could be through other means.</span> users who collect “transactions,” in our case achievements and assessments, into blocks which are then secured into the chain through investment of computational power based on all the blocks before them. This means that to change a transaction in the chain you also need to modify all the blocks based on it, reinvesting all the computational resources. As a result, users cannot remove or rectify mistakes or history on the chain. This makes it an ideal candidate for a long-term, secure, and verifiable educational system. If the entire network agrees on the same rules this allows it to dynamically control all elements, such as coin supply, through assessor payouts and new user creation, through the tokens or experience required.</p>

      <h2> The potential for society</h2>
      <p><span class="newthought">In the short</span> term, this system can reach beyond the range of our current educational institutions and provide learning opportunities to those not accustomed to them. It could provide a simple and efficient credential transfer method for multiple institutions with access to the same secure database. It can act as a backbone for distributed teams, or even create new teams working collaboratively. In each of these cases it could work for users of all backgrounds, from children supported by their parents to independent freelancers polishing their skills. These implementations would lead to huge increases in efficiency, accountability and accessibility in industries that are in sore need of them.<label for="10" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="10" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">It could be an ideal match for Government projects or NGOs, organizations towards a soceital benefit.</span></p>

      <p><span class="newthought">The long term </span> goal is the foundation of a fair, just, and meritocratic society, in which individuals, regardless of personal factors, have the freedom to learn and grow with each other, judged solely on individual achievements. The society would function on a ruleset unalterable by any malicious centralized power, categorizing the skillsets of each individual and giving others the information necessary to place those individuals within society. This provides the basis for a society based on action and fact, with each individual serving their best role in the larger whole.</p>

      <h2> What now and how</h2>
      <p><span class="newthought">We are not</span> developers. We are not experts in pedagogy or cryptography, sociology or economy. We are students, believers in the potential for a better educational system. Our intent is to start a discussion based on the ideas suggested here. We want people who are developers and teachers, and cryptographers and sociologists, to provide input, to change and develop everything we’ve come up with. We want to bring this to the attention of people who have power and influence in order to support and begin to build a system that will make the world a better place. Our hope in writing this lightpaper is that people will see it as a starting point, a very modest platform to build on, to create a better educational system that could be the foundation for a better society.</p>
